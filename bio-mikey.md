# Mikey

![mikey]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/mikey.png)

Born among the stylish and wealthy in Southern California, Mikey was abandoned by his people at an early age. On the streets of Orange Country he survived by eating garbage and running away from other dogs. Thanks to the good people at [Ginger's Pet Rescue](http://www.gingerspetrescue.org/) he found his way to a foster home in Seattle, Washington. 

Mikey was frightfully scared of other dogs, no matter how big or small. He met Erin, Mike, and Tulip around Thanksgiving of 2013. Tulip helped Mikey learn that other dogs can be his friends too. He was happy to get out of rainy Seattle and settle into his new home in Washington, D.C.

He loves treats of all kinds, especially sweet potatoes, and assumes that any person who to comes to visit is there to feed him. His pastimes include playing fetch with his lamb, snuggling his monkey, and digging under blankets. He eats anything, but his favorites are multigrain toast, collard green stalks, and carrots.

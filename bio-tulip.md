# Tulip

![tulip]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/tulip.png)

Born on the streets of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Tulip didn't experience human companionship until she and her sister were rescued by [Saving Satos](http://www.saveasato.org/). They were flown to Mount Vernon, Washington, where they stayed at a shelter run by [Animals in Need](http://www.animalsinneed.net/). 

Tulip joined Mike and Erin in 2012. She was scared of her new home and people, but she started to come around after a few weeks of home cooked food. Her friends at [Boston pee party](http://www.bostonpeeparty.net) showed her how much fun life with humans can be. 

She loved the trip cross country from Seattle to Washington, D.C., stopping to pee in every state along the way. Now she enjoys long walks in the city parks, removing squeakers from toys, and playing with the remote controls. Her favorite foods are sweet potatoes, multi-grain toast, and steamed broccoli.

# Who we are
We are PhDs, (trying hard to be) vegans for the last 4 years, who are married with no human kids but two fur babies. We moved from Seattle to Washington DC for work about a year ago and the transition was not easy. We both love food and cooking. Erin has a passion for fashion and is always looking for great vegan-friendly beauty products. Mike is a photography enthusiast who loves old cameras. [Tulip](/bio-tulip) was born on the streets of Puerto Rico and spent a year in shelter care after being flown to Seattle before we adopted her in 2011. [Mikey](/bio-mikey) joined our family in 2012; he is never without his monkey.

# What you will find here
Recipes and recommendations for great gourmet and everyday food. Great vegan and cruelty-free beauty products that we have personally tried and loved. Vegan fashion musing. Pet products we love and that our puppies love. Although we are called Veggie Puppy, we are mindful of our pets' health so we feed them high quality animal products. 

#What you will NOT find here
Preachy nonsense about how vegans are great! We have ideas, we want to share them with you. We are human, we make mistakes; we try our best to do better next time. I have bought products tested on animals before on accident because I trusted a sales person when I asked rather than checking for myself. Mike ended up knowingly ordering and eating fish on a trip to Japan because he is allergic to nuts and sesame seeds, and didn't want to risk dying. Life is hard, living a compassionate life can be hard. We are all just doing our best out here.

Everyone feels under the weather sometime and 'chicken' soup can never hurt. Canned soup is ok, but at least partly homemade is so much better.

I like to start with a good commercial vegan broth base and enhance it by adding clean veggie peels of carrots and other roots, celery, some onion and a healthy bunch of parsley. Boil until vegetables are colorless. While you are waiting, bring salted water to a boil for pasta and chop additional celery, carrot and onion and any other vegetable you have and enjoy and lightly saute in a very small amount of oil. 

At the very end add [Beyond Meat](http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=beyond%20meat&linkCode=ur2&tag=veggpupp-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&linkId=MIWHDBQXCH2NQM5G) grilled chicken to the pan and warm with vegetables. When they are all warm and the vegetables are bright and warm but still crunchy set them aside. Once water is boiling cook selected dried pasta as directed. When the boiling vegetables are colorless discard them into the compost and strain broth if pieces remain. Plate by adding pasta, vegetables and 'chicken' to the bottom of a bowl and pouring broth over them, top with some extra chopped parsley. Good enough to stop any flu in its tracks!

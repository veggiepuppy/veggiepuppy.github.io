Seitan is a protein-packed meat substitute that is made from wheat. Wheat flour is washed repeatedly to remove most of the carbohydrates and *vital wheat gluten* is left. You can find this in the bulk section of a decent grocery store or order [Bob's Red Mill Vital Wheat Gluten](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057RI0TY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0057RI0TY&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=ER3P6K24SKI6N5FU) online.  Pre-made seitan is often sold with other fake meats, but we have often found such products to be lacking in texture and overly expensive. One cup of wheat gluten yields about 1 pound of seitan, enough to feed 4-6 people. So, open up your spice cabinets and get to mixing!

Wheat is a completely neutral flavor, so season your home-made seitan aggressively, and be creative! Homemade seitan can be made in about 1 hour. We like to make large batches every 3 weeks or so. Seitan can be sliced and served immediately, refrigerated for up to a week, or sliced and frozen. To reheat, thaw or slice and fry in a cast-iron pan in olive oil. Serve on sandwiches, in salads, or simply with a side of kale. Note that seitan does not hold up in stews or stir frys because the long cooking process breaks down the wheat and it becomes mushy. 

## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 2 teaspoons onion powder
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- 1 cup vital wheat gluten
- 1.5 teaspoons condensed ``beef'' broth mixed into 3/4 cup water
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke
- 2 teaspoons [vegan Worcestershire sauce](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0078DP7GY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0078DP7GY&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=WPTTBKD5SNRHBB7G)
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 4 cups water

## What to do with them

1. Mix dry ingredients thoroughly
2. Stir broth, olive oil, liquid smoke, and worcestershire sauce together and add to dry mixture
3. Stir to combine and knead gently until combined, add additional water if needed
4. The dough should be firm, slightly tacky, and spongy. Roll into a ball and flatten into a disk or loaf shape.
5. Bring 4 cups water combined with soy sauce to a boil. Lower heat and add dough. Cover and simmer on medium low for 50 minutes. 
6. Remove seitan from broth and let cool. Cut into 4 pieces and store covered with the cooking liquid in the refrigerator. 


To serve, slice seitan into 1/4 inch slices and pan-fry quicky in a bit of olive oil. Serve with your favorite veggies, potatoes and gravy! More recipes coming soon!

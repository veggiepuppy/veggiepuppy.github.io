Raw, thick, creamy almonds. Slightly sweet and perfect for that morning cup of Joe. You'll need a powerful blender and a cheesecloth to make this at home, but it's worth it because there's nothing like it in the grocery store. When you are done, you'll have some leftover almond meal. Don't throw it out! We use it to make almond cheese, and even our own almond flour! Recipes coming soon.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup raw almonds
- Filtered water
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon agave nectar
- Pinch salt
- [Cheesecloth](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B14ODG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001B14ODG&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=X5XLQU65HMTDMQI3)

## What to do with them

1. Soak the almonds in water overnight and for up to 48 hours
2. Drain the almonds and put in a high powered blender, like a [Vitamix](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008H4SLV6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B008H4SLV6&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=XDR7F7XW6U5DYWIX)
3. Add enough water to just cover the almonds, should be about 3/4 cup
4. Add the rest of the ingredients (not the cheesecloth)
5. Blend on high for about 2-3 minutes. Stop to scrape down the sides if necessary
6. Place a double-layer cheesecloth over a bowl forming a well. Pour the mixture into the cloth
7. Wrap the cloth around the mixture and twist to squeeze the liquid out. This is a slow process and can take 10-15 minutes. 
8. Stop squeezing when thick meal starts to come through the cloth. Transfer the remaining almond meal into a separate container and reserve for other uses. 
9. Store the almond cream in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

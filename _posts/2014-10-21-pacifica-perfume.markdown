Vegan perfume can be a difficult thing to find, as a great many manufacturers test on animals and used animal based products. [Pacifica](http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=pacifica%20perfume&linkCode=ur2&sprefix=pacifica%2Caps%2C264&tag=veggpupp-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&linkId=OH7NU5TYA2C2N7UZ) has great and 100% cruelty-free perfumes. They are affordable, long lasting and come in lots of different delicious and exotic scents. All the perfumes are natural fruit or flowers. My favorite is [Indian coconut nectar](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048842N6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0048842N6&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=DBU2H3PETSNVU7RI), and I prefer the fruits to the flowers. However, the flower scents are more traditional and sure to delight even the most sophisticated of tastes.

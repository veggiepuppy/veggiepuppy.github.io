We were not vegans on our first trip to Paris many years ago and I loved salt-cod brandade. Traditionally, it is a southern French or Spanish dish made with salt cod, potatoes, and garlic. Here is my vegan version made with potatoes, arugula, and spices.

- 2 Tbs [garlic mayo](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OY1PNX0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00OY1PNX0&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=FF2D7KLY3HG75PLL)
- 1.5 tsp salt 
- 2 Tbs tarragon 
- 1 Tbs Thyme
- 1 pinch paprika 
- 1 tub [Treeline herb-garlic soft cashew cheese](http://www.treelinecheese.com/treeline-cheese-products.html)
- 2 cups baby arugula, washed and dried 
- 1-2 Tbs soy milk 
- 4 medium starchy potatoes, scrubbed clean, skins on
- 2 Tbs high smoke point oil (canola) 
- 1 tsp fresh ground white pepper
- 1 tsp vegan butter
- 4 Tbs grated black Spanish radish or other spicy radish


## What to do with them

1. Preheat oven to 375. 
2. Grate potatoes finely, while heating 1/4 oil in heavy skillet. Add 1/4 potato to pan in a thin single layer, let brown on edges before breaking up and turning over in the pan, continue in this manner until all the potatoes are browned and soft and the oil is finished. Place browned grates in a large bowl. 
3. Drain and rinse toona to remove most of the oil, break up into the bowl; remove any very dark pieces. 
4. Add 1/2 cup Daiya, mayo, vegan butter, salt, pepper, tarragon, thyme, paprika, treeline and mix into the potato tuna mixture. The mix should be loose enough that you could mix in arugula without breaking it into tiny pieces, but you could still make a ball with it. 
5. Add soy milk as needed to get to the correct consistency, then mix in arugula. 
6. Portion out into 4 ramekins if you wish or put the whole lot into a loaf pan. Top with remaining Daiya, cover pan and pop in oven for about 10 minutes or until heated through. 
7. Remove lid and leave in oven for 5 more minutes or until slightly browned on top. Remove from oven and serve with toasted or grilled bread and a side of grated radish.

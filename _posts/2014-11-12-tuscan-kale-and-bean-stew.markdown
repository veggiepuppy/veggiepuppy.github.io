Sticking with the kale theme this week, here's a great recipe for Tuscan aka lacinato kale. A warm, tomatoey, satisfying italian-style stew made with white beans, tomatoes, kale, garlic and spices. Eat by itself or serve with a side of pasta or quinoa.

- 1 bunch lacinato kale
- 1/2 handfull fresh parsley
- 3 leaves fresh oregano
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar

## What to do with them


1. Trim fennel fronds and slice bulb in two. Remove hard core by making two diagonal cuts into the base of the bulb halves. Slice remaining bulb. 
2. Heat oil in a stew pot over medium heat. Add onion and fennel with a pinch of salt. Cook for 7-9 minutes until slightly browned and translucent. 
3. Turn heat to high. Add garlic and first 3 spices to pot. Cook for 1 additional minute.
4. Strain beans and rinse thoroughly.
5. Add tomatoes, bay leaves, broth and beans to pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for about 40 minutes, until beans are nearly tender. 
6. Meanwhile, wash kale thoroughly and trim end of stems. Chop roughly and add to pot and cover. Simmer for 5-10 more minutes, until kale is cooked but still bright green. Remove from heat and stir to combine. 
7. Season stew with remaining herbs, vinegar, salt and pepper to taste. Remove bay leaves before serving. Serve with quinoa, rice, or pasta.

Kale, we should all be eating more of it. But how? Forget about the tough, bland garnish on the side of your plate. Kale should be fresh, seasonal, bright, and satisfying. There are many different varieties that one can aquire, so what to do with each kind?

## Curly Kale

Curly kale comes most commonly in the green variety, but there is also purple. Curly kale has curly, thick leaves, and hard ribs. It is best to wash, then pull the leaves off the ribs. Save the cruncy ribs for a dog treat!

Curly kale can be simply steamed for use in sandwiches, soups, or smoothies. Don't overcook! Five minutes in the steamer is plenty, the cooked leaves should be bright green. 

If you really want the kale to shine, braise it in a flavorful broth with onions, garlic and hot pepper. Check out the recipe below. 

### Braised Kale

#### Ingredients

- 1 bunch curly kale
- 1 small onion
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground fennel seed
- 1/2 cup vegetable broth
- 2 teaspoons white wine or rice vinegar

#### What to do with them

1. Wash kale thoroughly to remove any sand or dirt. Remove kale from stems. Chop roughly.
2. Peel, quarter and slice onion crosswise. 
3. In a deep, heavy pot with a lid, bring oil to medium heat on the stove. Add onion with a pinch of salt. Sweat onion about 5-7 minutes until translucent. 
4. Increase heat to high. Add garlic and seasonings to pan.  Saute for 1 minute.
5. Add liquid to pan and bring to a boil. Add kale and cover. Let braise for about 5 minutes. Kale should be tender but still be bright green when finished. Remove from heat. 
6. Season with about 2 teaspoons white wine or rice vinegar. Serve immediately. 

## Lacinato Kale

Lacinato kale is dark green, with thin, flat leaves, and soft stems. It's also known as Tuscan kale. The ribs are soft and edible, so simply chop of any rough ends and wash. 

Chopped finely, it goes great in a hearty salad with quinoa and tofu. It also makes a great subsitute for collards in our [Dirty Quinoa]({{ site.baseurl }}/recipes/2014/10/24/dirty-quinoa.html), just take 5 minutes off the cooking time. 


## Red Russian Kale

Red russian kale is a lesser known variety, but it is great when fresh and in season. It has delicate, flat leaves, and hard ribs. Pull the leave off the stems like you would curly kale. 

The leaves are so delicate, you can put them raw right on a sandwich for a flavor-packed substitute for lettuce. If you like them cooked, chop finely and saute quickly in a bit of olive oil.

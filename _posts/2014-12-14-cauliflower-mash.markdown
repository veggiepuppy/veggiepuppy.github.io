Cauliflower is a great addition to standard, boring mashed potatoes. The vegetable enhances the flavor and the nutrition of this side dish. Use a seasonal variety of cauliflower (different varieties are available throughout the year) in about a 1 to 1 ratio to potatoes, by weight. This is a great side to accompany [homemade seitan.]({{ site.baseurl }}/recipes/2014/11/22/homemade-seitan.html)

## Ingredients

- 1 head caulflower
- 3-4 medium sized russet potatoes, about 1 pound
- 2 tablespoons vegan butter or coconut oil
- 1/2 cup soy or almond milk, unsweetened
- 1 tablespoon fresh dill, or 1 teaspoon dried dill
- white pepper
- salt


## What to do with them

1. Wash the potatoes and boil in salted water for about 20 minutes, until very soft. 
2. Trim the leaves and the hard core from the cauliflower, leaving the florets and soft stems. Place in a saucepan with about 3/4 cup water. Bring water to a boil and cover. Steam for about 15 minutes, until fork tender. 
3. When potatoes and cauliflower are finished cooking, strain and add to a mixing bowl. Add vegan butter and smash with a potato masher. Mash until there are no more large chunks, but it should be slighly lumpy. 
4. Add milk and seasonings to bowl and whip with a wooden spoon until combined. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

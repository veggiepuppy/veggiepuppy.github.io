We all love hot dish, or stew, or chicken pot-pie less the chicken and double the gravy! Making it vegan and a little less terrible for you with a whole bunch of veggies is also a great idea.

## Ingredients

- 1 pack [Beyond Meat chicken](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OX70PRO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00OX70PRO&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=E7EFRO3P2V5Y5P5M), if frozen leave out while preparing rest of the dish. 
- 1 bunch collard greens, destemmed, washed, and ribbon cut 
- 2 to 3 medium carrots (rainbow for extra color) washed trimmed and cubed 
- 4 to 5 small turnips washed, trimmed and cubed 
- 1 8oz bag of frozen sweet peas 
- 1 small acorn or butternut or other winter squash, peeled, seeded and cubed 
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed or smashed and diced finely 
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced 
- 2 Tbls [Better than Bouillon No-chicken stock](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XM4UP2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004XM4UP2&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=M74D7JAC4NKVIBR6)
- 3 Tbls smart balance butter
- 1 Tbls coconut oil 
- 1/3 cup whole wheat floor 
- 1 tsp dry sage 
- 1 tsp dry thyme
- 1/2 tsp paprika  
- 2 cups water 
- salt and pepper to taste  

## What to do with them

In a large dutch oven, warm the coconut oil over medium heat until melted. Add onion, carrot, squash, turnips, collards and half of all the spices (except salt and pepper) and saute for several minutes until sweated slightly and browned edges are forming. Add garlic and saute for about a minute more, add water and bouillon, reduce heat and simmer until all vegetables are tender, but the collards are not yet mushy. 

Meanwhile, in a small saute pan, melt smart balance over medium heat and add in flour and mix until a paste forms and there is no loose flour to form a roux. After a thick paste forms, cook for about two minutes more, stirring to make sure it doesn't burn. The roux should be a few shades darker when ready, reduce heat and add a 1/2 cup of hot liquid from the vegetable pot, and whisk roux into the liquid until there are no lumps, this will get thick very fast so be careful not to burn. 

Stir thickened liquid into the vegetable pot to remove any lumps. Add peas and cubed 'chicken' and simmer until thickened and combined and peas and 'chicken' are warmed. Add remaining seasonings, including salt and pepper to taste and serve with a [biscuit (or 4)]({{ site.baseurl }}/recipes/2015/01/31/vegan-biscuits.html) on the top!

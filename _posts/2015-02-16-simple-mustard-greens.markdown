Four simple ingredients, everything should be so easy and so tasty. Much like the noble potato and the mighty leek, mustard greens and sweet aged balsamic go together so well little else is needed. A little fat for the saute and maybe a pinch of salt, perfection.

## Ingredients

- 1 bunch mustard greens, de-stemmed and cut chiffonade style
- 1 Tablespoons coconut oil 
- 1-2 Tablespoons of aged balsamic vinegar, the thicker and sweeter the better 
- 1 pinch of salt to taste, great use for the fancy fleur de sel you've been saving

## What to do with them

1. Heat oil on medium-high heat in a saute pan, place greens in all at once, tossing as needed to coat in oil and prevent sticking.
2. They will reduce greatly in size and darken in color, but do not allow to brown; about 4 to 5 minutes. 
3. Remove from heat and toss in vinegar. Taste before determining if salt is needed. If adding salt do so sparingly. Perfection!!!

Time for a short beauty post for the gentlemen as we review a [Taylor of Old Bond Street](http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=taylor%20of%20old%20bond&linkCode=ur2&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Ataylor%20of%20old%20bond&tag=veggpupp-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&linkId=WRGJFLDMNDKZVKRH) shaving cream. The company has many great vegan and never-animal tested shaving products even though they don't advertise it prominently. A favorite of mine is the [Almond Shave Cream](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AT0JZ0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002AT0JZ0&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=Q7HMA5IPEABWRRTH). It has a natural and fresh almond aroma that is great to wake up to. Paired with a [vegan brush](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W17O7A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004W17O7A&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=YRNPWK4ELZF5TWPN), it whips right up into a lather. Man or woman, try it out for a sustainable and cruelty-free shave.

To get a good lather, grab your brush and a coffee mug. Soak the brush in hot water inside the mug for about 3 minutes. Remove the brush, shake and squeeze dry. Dunk the tip of the brush in the cream to load it up with about a nickle sized amount of cream (a little goes a long way!). Discard all but a few drops of water. Start whipping the brush around the mug until foaming. Slowly add back in more hot water a few drops at a time while still whipping to build up a thick, creamy lather. Apply to clean but we skin and enjoy your shave!

![Dirty Quinoa with Collard Greens]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/collards.png)

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons sage powder
- 2 tablespoons paprika
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1/2 tablespoon ground cumin 
- 1 cup quinoa 
- 3 cups vegetable broth 
- 1 bunch collard greens
- 1 cup pink lentils 

## What to do with them

1. Add oil to deep walled pot with lid and warm over medium heat.
2. Add onion and pinch of salt to pot.  Sweat onions for about 6-7 minutes, until translucent, stirring occasionally.
3. Turn heat up to high. Add garlic and dry spices to pan and stir for 1 minute until aromatic.
4. Add quinoa to pan and stir. Toast quinoa for 1 minute.
5. Add broth to pan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and cover. Wait 15 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the collard greens.
6. For each green, cut through the leaves along both sides of the thick stems to separate. Discard the stems. Stack the leaves and roll up into a cylinder. Chop perpendicular to the roll to get 1/4 inch ribbons. 
7. Once the 15 minutes are up, add the lentils, stir and add collard greens on top. Cover and simmer for an additional 15 minutes. Check after 10 minutes and stir to mix in the greens. If no liquid remains after 10 minutes add another 1/2 cup water. Season with salt, black pepper, and vinegar to taste. 


### Modification 

Substitute any hardy green for the collards. Kale works wonderfully. If using Swiss chard, add only 5 minutes before the end of simmering time.

Being vegan doesn't mean you can't have a festive cheese plate. You can make or buy the cheese, we bought it in this case, but we have made it in the past!  If you want to make it [this is a great resource](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1570672830/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1570672830&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=COFJPUX6LMQZGXUT), post to come with our attempt at cheese making. On the plate, we have a variety of vegan nut cheeses, smoked tofu, Field Roast Deli slices, roasted beets, roasted red peppers, a locally made baguette, dolmades, calimyrna figs, and olive spread. Dress up with some dried fruit and jam you have a fruit plate. The dips pictured, recipes coming, seal the deal.

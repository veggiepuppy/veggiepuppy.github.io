Sunchokes, also known as jerusalem artichokes, are the starchy roots of sunflowers. They have a thin, edible skin and a firm starchy center that fries up or mashes like a potato. The flavor and texture combination is unique. We like them simply pan fried in a bit of oil, with salt and pepper.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 pound sunchokes
- 2 tablespoons vegan butter or coconut oil
- white pepper
- salt


## What to do with them

1. Wash the sunchokes, paying attention to remove all the dirt.
2. Trim the hard ends of the sunchokes, and slice each one it two lengthwise. Slice the larger sunchokes into quarters, aiming for about 1/4 inch thick slices. 
3. Bring a heavy-bottomed pan to medium-high heat. Add butter or oil. 
4. Add sunchokes in a single layer on the pan. Cook for about 5-7 minutes per side, flipping only once. 
5. Remove from pan when fork tender and well browned. Transfer to a towel to drain excess oil. Salt and pepper to taste while still hot.

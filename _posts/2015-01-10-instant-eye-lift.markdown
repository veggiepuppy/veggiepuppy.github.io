[The Trish Mcevoy eye lift](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474ORXQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00474ORXQ&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=MHABMHCUIKPY3T5C), is like a magic eraser for black bags and under eye puff. A tip that was shared with me, and that works very well: take out the wand, and roll the sponge out on the back of your hand, this will be plenty for both eyes. Dab the wand in the concealer on your hand and draw an upside down triangle on under each eye, from the corners of your eyes to the bottom of your bag. Fill in each triangle with small dots of concealer from the back of your hand. Blend with your fingers or a foundation/concealer brush.  Perfect!

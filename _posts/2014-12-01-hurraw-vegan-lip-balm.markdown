Hurraw lip balm is 100% vegan, cruelty free, organic and raw. They come in lots of great smelling varieties, [like coconut](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MRUMDC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004MRUMDC&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=IZTUF2FU5S5LEEWV). At under 4$ these long lasting balms give great chapped lip coverage with just a little bit of shine.

Who says vegan food has to be healthy? Here we create a vegan version of a classic deli sandwich: the Italian cold-cut sub. Heaps of tofurky on top of shredded kale, tomatoes, pickled peppers, and spices.

## What to do with them

1. Slice the roll lengthwise, and pull out some of the soft innards of the bread. 
2. Place 1 layer each of the deli slices on the roll, my favorite combo is bologna, smoked turkey, pepperoni, and italian sausage.
3. Layer the tomato slices, onion, and pepperoncini. 
4. Top with shredded kale. 
5. Season with oil, vinegar, oregano, salt and pepper. 
6. Close the bread gently, slice and share with your friends!

I love foamy lush body wash as much as the next puppy, but bar soup really is more environmentally friendly, particularly when you find a brand that uses a simple paper box covering that can be recycled. I love [Dr Woods bar soap](http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=dr%20woods%20bar%20soap&linkCode=ur2&tag=veggpupp-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&linkId=AJGELEKWHH3NLGGU). Simple paper box cover, vegan, great skin loving varieties, and best off all will not break the bank and is available at Yes organic markets, Whole Foods and many other chain groceries. My favorites are the Raw Black Shea Butter Soap and the coconut Milk Raw Shea Butter Soap.

If you really must have body wash, we see two options: expensive vegan brands like Aveda and Body Shop, which will check all the boxes but cost you are pretty penny or some DIY with Dr. Woods or Bronner's liquid soap in a foaming dispenser. Although this still creates more waste than the bar, if you buy the largest possible containers and recycle what you can it is not terrible.

If you pick [Dr. Bronner's liquid soap](http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=dr%20bronners%20liquid%20soap&linkCode=ur2&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Adr%20bronners%20liquid%20soap&tag=veggpupp-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&linkId=XD5COPECNNVGIIBL) in a scent you love, it can also be used for many other cleaning jobs around the house. Making your own cleaning products from Bronner's is a different post all together, but with no modifications it can be used to wash dishes, clothes and puppies as well as yourself and diluted on wood floors and many other surfaces. (Just read a bottle for the endless list of things they think can be done with Bronner's).

Dr. Woods liquid soaps seem to me to be formulated more for skin care, which is why I prefer them for a bit of luxury, while I always have Bronner's on hand for the diverse cleaning needs of a two person, two puppy household, I will stick with my bar of [coconut Milk Raw Shea Butter Soap](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0073FQHSO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0073FQHSO&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=UOTV2NAG2BNV4DRB) for the shower.

This is a creamy and hearty soup, full of earthy mushroom flavor. The combination of dried porcinis and sauteed creminis makes this soup a complex and refined, perfect for entertaining. Use your preferred non-dairy milk, but we strongly suggest the unsweetened version. We suggest creminis and dried porcinis because they are widely found, but use whatever mushrooms you have available. The wilder the better!

## Ingredients
- 1 package dry porcini mushrooms
- 16 oz fresh cremini mushrooms
- 3 tablespoons vegan butter 
- 8 oz almond or soy milk unsweetened (really really not 'original')
- 1 tablespoon ['no beef' better than bouillon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W9SLPQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004W9SLPQ&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=ACU5ZUVDI6MUVVH2">Better Than Bouillon Vegetarian No Beef Base -- 8 oz</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=veggpupp-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B004W9SLPQ)
- 8 oz of hot water 
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 clove of garlic, finely chopped or pressed
- 2 teaspoons pepper, I like freshly ground green pepper corns 
- 1 liter cold water 
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 4 oz vegan friendly wine

## What to do with them

1. Rehydrate dry mushrooms in the 8oz of hot water and let stand. 
2. Slice the cremini mushrooms in 1/8th inch pieces after cleaning and trimming the very end of the stems. In a dutch oven warm 1 tablespoon of vegan butter on medium-high until almost smoking and add one half of the sliced mushrooms. Brown the mushrooms until golden brown, and then remove them from the pot. Repeat with an addtional tablespoon of butter and the rest of the sliced mushrooms.
3. Once the mushrooms are browned, remove them and add the last tablespoon of butter and reduce heat to medium. Once the butter has melted add onion and salt and sweat the chopped onion until translucent. 
4. While cooking the onion, drain rehydrated porchini-reserving liquid, and chop. Add finely chopped garlic and porchini to onions continue cooking until onion is slightly browned. 
5. Add reserved liquid from the mushrooms and wine to pot, scraping the bottom to remove any stuck on bits, bring to a boil and reduce liquid by 1/3. 
6. Add the cold water, half the browned mushrooms and the tablespoon of broth base; bring back to a boil. 
7. Remove from heat and pour into a high powered blender. Blend on high until completely uniform and creamy looking. (I use a Vita and it takes about 1 minute on high, other blenders will likely take longer). 
8. Place liquid back in pot, add remaining mushrooms, milk and pepper, stir, and let simmer over low heat for 20-30 minutes. It will thicken slightly as it simmers. Serve in small bowls as a first course for a plated meal or in shot glasses for a buffet or cocktail party.

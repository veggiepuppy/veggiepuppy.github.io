Doesn't do a lot of things: doesn't really curl and doesn't really thicken lashes, but it also doesn't test on animals, doesn't EVER SMUDGE (EVER), doesn't take anything other than mild soap and water to get off, doesn't fade and never clumps. I don't wear make-up often, but when I do, I forget that I am wearing it and rub my eyes. [TM's mascara](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00132AI1K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00132AI1K&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=C6HA6OVSQMBSPVP3) stays in place and never smudges. It goes on wet, and needs a few more seconds to dry, but it is worth it for the all day smudge-proof wear. It doesn't provide much volume, but it gives good length with no need to comb out clumps. I love it for dress-up work days and nights out, alike.

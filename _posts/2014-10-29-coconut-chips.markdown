Puppies love them! Make sure to get the [organic nothing but coconut version](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4D5IU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000F4D5IU&linkCode=as2&tag=veggpupp-20&linkId=SKNK67JIPBIFSEBY); no sugar added. They are high in fat but relatively low in calories. They sell versions in the pet store, but the human version is cheaper and more highly regulated. Even if you don't buy them for treats, remember the next time you are baking with coconut that those begging puppies can have a great treat! As with all treats, give in moderation.

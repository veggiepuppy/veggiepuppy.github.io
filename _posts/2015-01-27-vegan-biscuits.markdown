Perfect for a lazy weekend brunch at home, serve these biscuits with some veggie sausage gravy, homemade fruit jam, tofu scramble, or all of the above. The key to getting flaky biscuits is to handle the dough as little as possible. This ensures that the vegan butter does not melt before baking. If you don't have a biscuit cutter, use a coffee mug, or jar lid.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup unsweetend soy or almond milk
- 1 tsp apple cider vinegar
- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 3/4 tsp baking soda
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 3/4 tsp salt
- 4 Tbsp unsalted vegan butter (like Earth Balance)


## What to do with them

1. Put vegan butter in the freezer for a few minutes while preparing the rest. Preheat oven to 450F. 
2. Whisk together milk and vinegar in a bowl. Set aside to thicken. 
3. Sift together dry ingredients. 
4. Remove butter from freezer and cut into small cubes. Add to flour mixture and use a dough cutter or fork to mash butter into the flour. Use fingers to break up larger pieces, but be careful not to overhandle. The goal is to get lots roughly pea-sized chunks of butter surrounded by flour. 
5. Add milk to the flour and mix gently until incorporated. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and fold gently 2 times. Roll out dough into 1/2 inch thick sheet and cut holes out and place on a sheet pan. Reform the leftover dough and cut into squares or triangles. 
6. Bake at 450F for about 15 minutes, until golden-brown. Serve immediately, they don't last long!

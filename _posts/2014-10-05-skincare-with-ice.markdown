You have an event in 2 weeks and your skin is looking dull and you have some break-outs. You could do the research to find a place that does vegan/cruelty-free facials/peels, get one, hope you react well and win if you do. If you are in Seattle you are in luck, because [Cassie's Skincare](http://www.cassiesskincare.com/) exists. It's the greatest ever skincare mecca, ask Lisa to use the [Bion line](http://bionresearch.com/): never tested on animals and works GREAT. All us other poor saps, could instead do the cheapest and easiest thing in the world and save a lot of time and money: ICE.

What you need, ice cubes made with filtered water, a watch and a willingness to cause yourself a little brain-freeze. You will also need the commitment to keep icing AM and PM for 2 weeks or as long as you have before your event. Breaking your face into 5 sections, left cheek to temple, right cheek to temple, chin and lip area, nose and under eyes, and forehead, ice each section, moving the ice in circular motions, for 30 seconds. This is a total of 2 minutes and 30 seconds or icing, twice a day. 

It is not great fun, but oh boy does it work. Wash your face afterwards with your normal wash and apply whatever other stuff you use like normal. This will clear up break-outs and prevent new ones, improve texture and pore size and will not cost you more than some time and a little bit of discomfort. This hurts no one, other than yourself, is environmentally friendly, and completely cruelty-free. You will also get used to the ice and it will annoy you less after a few days, I promise.

When cleaning and de-stemming collard greens or kale (recipes to come), save some of the thinner pieces of stem for puppy chew treats. You can keep them in the freezer for months, and in the summer super cold ones are even better.  Puppies love them because they are crunchy. They help clean teeth because they are fibrous and have tons of essential vitamins. They are a low calorie treat that are great even for 'fluffy' puppies.  Just be careful not to feed too many in one sitting, or all that fiber may lead an accident!
